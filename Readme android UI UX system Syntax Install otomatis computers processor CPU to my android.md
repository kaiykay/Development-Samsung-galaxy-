## 1. Introduction

This system allows Android developers to integrate CPU information retrieval and real-time monitoring in their apps. It provides functions to read CPU details from the system, track CPU usage, and display performance metrics in an easy-to-understand manner.

---

## 2. System Requirements

- **Android Studio** for development.
- An Android device or emulator running **Android 5.0 (Lollipop)** or later.
- Basic knowledge of **Kotlin** or **Java** programming languages.

---

## 3. Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (If Applicable)
If the project is hosted in a version-controlled repository, clone it using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/android-cpu-monitor.git

Step 2: Set Up the Project in Android Studio

Open Android Studio and import the project or create a new Android project, adding the necessary dependencies for the system.

Step 3: Add Required Permissions

Add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml to allow access to CPU information:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

Step 4: Compile and Run

Once the project is set up, build and run it on your Android device or emulator.

4. Code Syntax and Explanation

Fetching CPU Information

The following Kotlin code fetches CPU details from the /proc/cpuinfo system file:

import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import java.io.BufferedReader
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.IOException

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Get CPU Information
        val cpuInfo = getCpuInfo()
        println("CPU Info: $cpuInfo")
    }

    // Function to Read CPU Info from /proc/cpuinfo
    private fun getCpuInfo(): String {
        var cpuInfo = "Unknown CPU"
        try {
            val reader = BufferedReader(FileReader("/proc/cpuinfo"))
            var line: String? = reader.readLine()
            while (line != null) {
                if (line.startsWith("Processor") || line.startsWith("model name")) {
                    cpuInfo = line.split(":")[1].trim()
                    break
                }
                line = reader.readLine()
            }
            reader.close()
        } catch (e: IOException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
        return cpuInfo
    }
}

Explanation:

This code reads the /proc/cpuinfo file and extracts the CPU model name.

It then displays the CPU information within the app.



---

5. Monitoring CPU Usage

To monitor CPU usage, you can use system commands such as top to track real-time CPU performance:

import java.io.BufferedReader
import java.io.InputStreamReader

fun getCpuUsage(): String {
    val process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("top -n 1")
    val bufferedReader = BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(process.inputStream))
    val output = bufferedReader.readText()
    return output
}

Explanation:

This method executes the top command and reads the CPU usage data directly from the device.

The output contains detailed information about CPU utilization, memory, and other stats.



---

6. Automating CPU Monitoring

For continuous or periodic CPU monitoring, you can implement a background service using Android's JobScheduler or WorkManager.

Background Service Example:

import android.app.Service
import android.content.Intent
import android.os.IBinder

class CpuMonitoringService : Service() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // Periodically fetch CPU usage data here
    }

    override fun onBind(intent: Intent?): IBinder? {
        return null
    }
}

Setting Up the Service:

Use JobScheduler or WorkManager to run this service periodically, which will fetch and log CPU data at set intervals, even if the app is in the background.



---

7. Troubleshooting

Issue 1: No CPU Information Displayed

Cause: The /proc/cpuinfo file may not contain the expected data on all devices. Solution: Ensure proper permissions are set, and verify that the device has accessible CPU information.

Issue 2: CPU Usage Not Updating

Cause: The command used for fetching CPU stats may not be providing real-time data. Solution: Consider using other system commands like top or use Android's ActivityManager for CPU usage.
