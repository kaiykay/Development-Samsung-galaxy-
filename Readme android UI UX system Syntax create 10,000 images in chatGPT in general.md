How to Generate 10,000 Images

1. Enter a Prompt: In the UI, provide a detailed description of the images you'd like to generate. For example:

"Generate 10,000 variations of a serene landscape at sunset with different weather conditions."


2. Start Image Generation: Once the user submits the prompt, ChatGPT will create detailed prompts for each image, which will be sent to the image generation system.


3. Batch Processing: The system will generate and process images in batches of 100 or 1,000 to ensure smooth operation.


4. Review Generated Images: The generated images will be displayed in the UI for review. You can download or further refine images.



Sample Code for Image Generation

Here is a simple implementation using the ChatGPT API to generate detailed prompts for images.

fun generateImage(prompt: String): String {
    val chatGPTResponse = chatGPTApi.generatePrompt(prompt)
    return chatGPTResponse
}
