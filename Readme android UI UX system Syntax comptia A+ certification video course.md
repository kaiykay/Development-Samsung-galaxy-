Here is a README file in Markdown format for the Android UI/UX system, reflecting the concepts from the CompTIA A+ certification:

# Android Document UI/UX System

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Document UI/UX System for Android. The app allows users to view, create, edit, and save documents. The design follows key principles of Android UI/UX development, incorporating concepts relevant to the **CompTIA A+** certification.

## Features

- **Document List View**: Displays a list of saved documents using `RecyclerView`.
- **Create New Document**: Allows users to create new documents via a floating action button (FAB).
- **Document Detail View**: Users can view and edit document details (title and content).
- **Save and Cancel Options**: Users can save or cancel changes to the document.
- **Responsive UI**: The app adjusts gracefully across different screen sizes.

## CompTIA A+ Concepts Applied

This project incorporates several principles relevant to the **CompTIA A+** certification:
- **UI Design Principles**: Consistency, simplicity, and clarity in interface layout.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Smooth transitions, user feedback, and intuitive navigation.
- **Hardware Interaction**: Basic file storage and data management practices.
- **Security**: While not fully implemented, consider using proper data storage practices such as database encryption in production environments.

## Requirements

- **Android Studio**: Use Android Studio to build and run the project.
- **SDK Version**: Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher.
- **Gradle**: Ensure that the projectâ€™s Gradle files are up-to-date.
